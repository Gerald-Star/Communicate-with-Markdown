## Step 7
What is a task list? A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. 
A task list starts with the syntax - [ ] and then the task list item. The formatting is specific!
Example
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
- [ ] 


How it looks
 List syntax is required
 This item is complete
 This item is not complete
